## 🐞 Issue: Update Contributors List

### Description
The contributors list needs to be updated to reflect recent project participants.  
This helps maintain proper attribution and keeps project documentation accurate.

---

### Problem
The current `contributors.txt` file does not include all contributors who have recently worked on the project.

---

### Proposed Solution
- Review the existing contributors list
- Add missing contributor names at the end of the file
- Ensure formatting remains consistent

---

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New contributor names are added
- [ ] Existing content is not modified or removed
- [ ] File formatting remains unchanged

---

### Additional Notes
This is a beginner-friendly task and a good first issue for new contributors.
