## Overview

This issue tracks our efforts to improve the project documentation to make it more accessible and helpful for new contributors and users. We aim to enhance the overall documentation quality by updating existing content and adding new resources.

## Goals

- Provide clearer and more comprehensive setup instructions
- Create beginner-friendly getting started resources
- Ensure all documentation is accurate, up-to-date, and well-organized
- Establish clear contribution guidelines for community members

## Tasks

- [ ] Update README with clearer setup instructions
- [ ] Add a Getting Started page to the Wiki
- [ ] Review and improve existing documentation
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines

## Notes

- Each task should be tracked individually and marked as complete when finished
- Documentation should follow best practices and be accessible to users of all skill levels
- Consider adding screenshots, code examples, and troubleshooting sections where appropriate
- All documentation changes should be reviewed by at least one other team member before being finalized
